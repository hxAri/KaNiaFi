# KaNiaFi
Processor and Service Implementation to manage **[Kanashī](https://github.com/hxAri/Kanashi)** request response results using Apache NiFi or Niagara Files. This will hopefully make it easier for you to manage every response stored by **[Kanashī](https://github.com/hxAri/Kanashi)**, this almost includes extracting user data from various schemas, separating each type of request with an easy Relationship branching feature. It fully works with Apache NiFI version **1.22.0** and requires at least **JDK v17** to compile the source code and run it on your local machine or server where you host Apache NiFi.

For instructions on the Custom Processor Installation process, please see the official documentation from the Apache NiFi developer for more details, I will not provide it here, learn to be independent.
